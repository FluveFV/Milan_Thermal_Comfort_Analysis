## Thermal Comfort Analysis
This repo is part of a collaboration between the University of Trento's teachers M. Napolitano, D. Giuliani and Transform Transport for the course of Geospatial Analysis. 

In this project, I attempt several analyses - mainly clustering and a simple spatial autoregression - to analyze the heat distribution and its relationship with the urban surroundings in a downtown neighbourhood in Milan. 

For a complete list of modules utilized in this repository, please check "requirements.txt". This whole project was implemented on pyhton 3.8, using mostly sci-kit, pandas, geopandas and numpy, and 

You can find the report [here](https://github.com/FluveFV/Milan_Thermal_Comfort_Analysis/blob/main/Milan%20PET%20analysis_Report.pdf). At the time of writing, no indication or recommendation was explicit for this project from teachers, but only from Transform Transport. I was the only student who decided to take up the opportunity; although I loved the geospatial analysis course, this was an incredibly difficult challenge given it is my very first geospatial project, which could explain the underperforming models.
